# Interactive Data Viz with Jupyter and Python
## Exploring Interactive Data Viz with Mobi Bike Share Data ðŸš²


A home for my interactive data viz slides [currently a work in progress]...

### Notebook & Slides

An interactive and executable version of these slides are available in a Jupyter notebook via Binder through the button below:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jessimk/interactive_data_viz/master?filepath=Jupyter_Interactive_Data_Viz.ipynb)

Source slides are in this [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jessimk/interactive_data_viz/blob/master/Jupyter_Interactive_Data_Viz.ipynb) and can also be viewed with [nbviewer here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jessimk/interactive_data_viz/blob/master/Jupyter_Interactive_Data_Viz.ipynb?flush_cache=true).

### Data
Data for this presentation is a subset of [Mobi's June 2018 system data](https://www.mobibikes.ca/en/system-data). 

I've compiled and added station geolocation for the purpose of this presentation.

I've also calculated a peak trip departure hour for each station, based on June 2018 trip data. This is basically just the mode 'hour', or the most frequently occurring departure hour in the June 2018 data set per station.

The data for the presentation can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jessimk/interactive_data_viz/master/mobi_data_presentation_subset.csv).

### Thank Yous

I'd like to acknowledge and thank [Dr. Tiffany Timbers](https://github.com/ttimbers) for their support with this presentation. ðŸŽ‰
