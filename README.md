# Interactive Data Viz with Jupyter and Python
## Exploring Interactive Data Viz with Mobi Bike Share Data ðŸš²


A home for my interactive data viz slides [currently a work in progress]...

Slides are in this Jupyter notebook and can be viewed best with nbviewer [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jessimk/interactive_data_viz/blob/master/Jupyter_Interactive_Data_Viz.ipynb) with all of the interactive awesome.

Data for this presentation is a subset of Mobi's [Aug 2018 system data](https://www.mobibikes.ca/en/system-data). I've compiled and added station geolocation for the purpose of this presentation.

The data for the presentation can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jessimk/interactive_data_viz/master/mobi_data_presentation_subset.csv).
